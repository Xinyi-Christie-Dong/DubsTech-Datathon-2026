To deepen the analysis, we augmented the 2025 dataset with air quality records from 2020–2024, transforming a single-year snapshot into a six-year longitudinal study.
This expansion serves two key goals:

Stronger Comparisons: Benchmarking 2025 levels against extreme events—such as the 2020 wildfire season—clarifies long-term trends and signs of atmospheric recovery across California.

Better Forecasting: Multi-year data improves model accuracy by capturing seasonality, climate shocks, and policy impacts, enabling stronger predictions of future median AQI and earlier detection of emerging high-risk hotspots.
